# Public Health Trends Frontend App in React Native & TypeScript

The official NativeBase TypeScript template for [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/)

## Technologies

1. ### [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/intro-react-native-components)

2. ### [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/)

3. ### [NativeBase UI Library](https://docs.nativebase.io/?utm_source=HomePage&utm_medium=header&utm_campaign=NativeBase_3)

## Themes (Dark Mode)

NativeBase has a wealth of theming functionality. See [here](https://docs.nativebase.io/3.0.x/color-mode) for details.

## Development Instructions

Currently, docker-compose does not work. To run the app via npm, change directory to ./app, then run the following

```
npm start
```

### Web version

When given the option, press "w" to run the web version of the app.

### Phone versions

You can also try to android version, but you'll need to access it through one of two ways:

1. download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), configure it properly, add a virtual device, and have React Native display on the emulated device

2. download the [Expo](https://expo.dev/client) app from the Goolge Play Store, or Expo Go from Apple's App Store, and use the QR Code generated in the CLI to get the app running on your phone
